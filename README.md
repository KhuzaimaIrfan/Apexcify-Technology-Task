# Apexcify Technology Task

This repository contains multiple machine learning and web application projects completed as part of the Apexcify Technology Task assignment. Each project covers different aspects of real-world application development, including image classification, object detection, and chatbot implementation.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository has the following main folders:

### 🧠 Image Classifier
A project that uses a machine learning model to classify webcam images into different categories. It includes:
- Pretrained model files
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for real-time browser classification
- TensorFlow.js integration for live prediction

### 🤖 Object Detection (YOLO)
This folder contains an object detection project that uses the YOLO model for detecting and drawing bounding boxes around real-world objects in images or video input.

### 💬 FAQ ChatBot
A simple chatbot system built to answer frequently asked questions. It may involve rule-based responses or a machine learning model to interpret queries.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Projects in this repository use a combination of the following technologies:

- **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript** – Frontend user interface and interaction
- **TensorFlow.js** – Running machine learning models in the browser
- **Teachable Machine** – Model training and export (for image classifier)
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** – Object detection algorithm
- **Python / Jupyter Notebook** – For trained models or scripts (if included)

## 🚀 How to Run

### Image Classifier
1. Open the `Image Classifier` folder.
2. Run a local server (such as Live Server for VS Code or `python -m http.server`).
3. Allow webcam access when prompted.
4. The browser will show real-time predictions.

### Object Detection (YOLO)
1. Navigate into the folder.
2. Follow instructions in that folder’s own README or run scripts via Python if applicable.

### FAQ ChatBot
1. Open the chatbot folder.
2. Use the provided scripts or notebook to launch the chatbot interface.

## 📌 Notes

- No backend server is required for the browser-based projects.
- Some projects may require Python and related libraries if they include trained machine learning code.
